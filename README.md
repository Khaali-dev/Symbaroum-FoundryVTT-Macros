# Symbaroum-FoundryVTT-Macros

Several macros, to use with the Symbaroum system in FoundryVTT.

Combat macro needs the "token counters" module.
Attack and damage are rolled and target toughness decrease. I am currently integrating the different abilities and status (advantage, poison, cursed...)

UsePower macro let the player or gamemaster use powers and several abilities (loremaster, witchsight,...). 

IT IS A WORK IN PROGRESS. The macros are stable, but currently the html is ugly and only a fraction of powers and abilities are supported.
For the moment, they are in french only.

in order to use the html templates, you have to put them somewhere in your data folder, and link it
